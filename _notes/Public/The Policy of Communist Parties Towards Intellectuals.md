One of the most important consequences of the scientific and technological revolution as well as of state monopoly capitalism over the past decades is the numerical growth and increasing influence of intellectuals in economic and social life. At the same time, the number of peasants has decreased considerably and the share of "traditional" urban middle strata has become relatively stable. The growth of intelligentsia and its greater significance in society make it vital for communists to work for a strong alliance between workers and intellectuals. It is relevant to recall what V.I.Lenin said to this effect: "No forces of darkness can withstand an alliance of the scientists, the proletariat and the technologists"¹.

  

The 1969 International Meeting also underlined the importance of this problem: "The alliance of workers by hand and by brain is becoming an increasingly important force in the struggle for peace, democracy and social progress, for the democratic control of production, of cultural institutions and information media and for the development of public education in the interests of the people” .

  

What are the prospects for a strong alliance between workers and intellectuals today and what are the obstacles? To find a correct answer to this question it is necessary to consider changes which have taken place in the objective socio economic position of intellectuals as well as the impact of these changes on political and ideological attitudes of a broad mass of mental workers in capitalist countries.

  

**Position and role of intellectuals in capitalist countries**

  

The appearance of intellectuals was originally related to the division between mental and physical labour. Today we refer to intellectuals people engaged in professional,highly-skilled mental labour which demands special training, usually higher education. The social function of intellectuals consists in elaborating, disseminating and transmitting scientific and cultural values. This function has urged many intellectuals in capitalist countries to take a socially critical attitude towards the regime based on exploitation of workers and, therefore, opposed to the human dimension of culture.

  

Prior to the appearance of intellectuals the exploitive classes had monopolised mental activities (although such mono poly could not have been absolute and the exploited classes also produced ideologists of their own). The advent of capitalism had changed the situation, producing intellectuals who made a living selling their labour force or products of their work. Initially, those were, as a rule, formally independent and economically self-sufficient specialists, so-called "professionals" (this term is often used today to denote intellectuals). Their socio-economic position, like that of the petty bourgeoisie, was intermediate. Therefore, they are termed in Marxism as a "stratum".

  

At the early stages of capitalist development the narrowness of this stratum, the lack of access to education resulted in the fact that intellectuals were produced mainly by the propertied classes while the children of workers and peasants had little or no chance to become intellectuals. The relative privileges and higher wages enjoyed by intellectuals enabled many of them to enter the bourgeois class, although the bulk of them can only be termed as the petty bourgeoisie.

  

The development of such factors as state-monopoly tendencies, scientific and technological progress, "mass culture", mass media, etc. caused the growth of various groups of intellectuals in capitalist countries. On the whole, intellectuals have become a large group of the working people. They account for 10-20 percent of the able population in capitalist countries.

  

The intelligentsia has grown at an especially high rate over the past 20-25 years, which is faster than any other class or group. In the USA, for example, the annual increase of the number of scientists was 7.5 per cent in 1960-70, that of engineers - 5.2 per cent while the annual increment of the total manpower did not go beyond 1.3 per cent. At present, the largest groups of intellectuals in capitalist countries are teachers and professors, administrative personnel, engineers, technicians, medical personnel. At the same time, the share of traditional bourgeois intellectuals, like lawyers, has dropped dramatically.

  

The number of students (a reserve for the intelligent sia) has grown rapidly. In the six leading capitalist countries (the USA, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy) the number of students increased from 3.2 mln in 1950 to 18 mln in 1975, i.e. almost a sixfold increase over 25 years.

  

In developing countries of Asia and Africa the rates of growth of intellectuals and students are also high, although they are not so numerous and have a different structure. Intellectuals engaged in production or technology are rare in those countries; they usually merge with the bourgeoisie. At the same time, there are too many civil servants. Their upper sections have become the bureaucratic bourgeoisie while the lower sections receive a meagre salary and have to live a semi-proletarian life. Relatively big and socially active is the military intelligentsia - the officers.

  

The numerical growth has not been the only change in the position of intellectuals in capitalist countries over the past few years. Its social and class position has also changed, proletarisation being the main tendency here. An overwhelming majority of intellectuals are working for hire. Subjected to exploitation, their lower sections, low skill professionals, come close to the working class and sometimes even merge with it. Intellectuals termed as "professionals" have actually become an anachronism because even traditionally "independent" intellectuals as doctors, lawyers, writers, painters, etc. work for a living in private clinics, lawyers' bureaus, publicity agencies, etc. Even the formally professionals who have retained the legal ownership of their offices are also dominated by the big capital (through commissions, clients, etc.). All that fully proves a statement by K.Marx and F.Engels that "the bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers."

  

The nature of intellectuals' work has also changed accordingly. Individual, craftsmanlike work is giving way to industrial, collective effort. Specialisation of mental work is becoming narrower, it is being divided in operations and is done according to pre-conceived programmes. Performance super sedes creation thus depriving the intellectuals of their select and privileged position. Any intellectual understands that he can be replaced at any time by another such "wheel" produced at the "factory of knowledge". The greater social significance of the intelligentsia thus results in the devaluation of its "microelements" or individual representative of this stratum.

As far as their salary is concerned, the intellectuals also come close to the working class; certain professions like teachers are paid even less than skilled workers. Intellectuals are equally hit by unemployment which became especially acute during the world economic crisis in the 1970-s. In the USA, for example, unemployment among college graduates reached almost 8 per cent in 1972. In France unemployment among professionals has increased 10 times against 1966 while the total unemployment has increased 6 times. Unemployed intellectuals suffer most of all in less developed countries where they do not get relief and, at the same time, do not think it fit to do physical work.

  

These tendencies have worked against a background showing the numerical growth of so-called "white collars" to whom Western sociologists refer all those engaged in nonphysical work, i.e. not only highly-skilled specialists but also a huge mass of trade and office employees, technicians, laboratory assistants, junior medical personnel, etc. In the USA, those engaged in non-physical work have outnumbered those doing physical work. The same tendency is at work in other capitalist countries. Although the lower sections of the "white collars” are not usually classified as intellectuals, it is clear that the work of intellectuals is largely dependent on the work of these sections, auxiliary as it may be. Their position places them between intellectuals proper and the industrial proletariat and makes them particularly liable to proletarisation.

  

A tendency for the proletarisation of intellectuals also manifests itself in the democratisation of their social composition. Of course, the share of workers' children among students continues to be incommensurate with the share of the working class in the total population. Yet, the scientific and technological revolution which demands a drastic increase in the number of mental workers as well as the struggle of the working class and the masses for greater access to education. have led to a certain democratisation of the intellectuals' social composition in capitalist countries. The engineering and technical intelligentsia in the capitalist countries is now being drawn not only from the bourgeoisie but also from the middle sections and in part from among the working people as well.

  

What we have just said does not reflect in full the social position of intellectuals, which is extremely contradictory. The upper layers of the intelligentsia can well be classed as the bourgeoisie, sometimes even as the monopoly bourgeoisie. Professional knowledge is now indispensable to be able to manage bourgeois property and to exercise political power. We must also refer to the bourgeoisie the top administrative personnel, so-called managers and technocrats whose excessively high salaries include part of the surplus value. Certain ambitious scientists, engineers, technologists, etc. can also become capitalists. Technocratic intellectuals who are eager to join the top layers of the bourgeoisie, also seek to sustain and modernise the capitalist order. They hope to solve all social problems with the help of technical means and dream about the power of an "intellectual elite". Among well known proponents of this doctrine are R.Aron in France, E.Sheels and Z.Brzezinski in the USA, H.Schelski in West Germany, etc.

  

Yet, the greater part of professionals are still termed as intermediate or "middle strata". Although they are exploited by the big capital, they themselves exploit their junior staff. They differ from workers by their social status (in production, for example, they are often overseers), by their social and professional interests (career-seeking, etc.) and often by their bourgeois political-ideological outlook.

  

Intellectuals are highly differentiated economically. Intellectual positions differ from one another in terms of remuneration much more than workers' jobs. Lawyers and doctors are paid comparatively high salaries, which is one of the reasons for their traditional conservatism. Differences in the economic standards of intellectuals are determined not so much by their professional status as by their class position and their place in the official hierarchy.

  

The general deterioration of the intellectuals' economic and social position in capitalist countries, their objective closeness to the working class have exerted much influence on many intellectuals, involving them in class struggle. Lenin's words that the intelligentsia attaches itself to the wage-workers  ‘’as capitalism increasingly deprives the intellectual of his independent position, converts him into a hired worker and threatens to lower his living standard’’, are true to this day.

  

No other social group has ever developed so acute socioeconomic heterogeneity and ideological contradictions which often overshadow the sense of social identity. V.I.Lenin said that the intelligentsia "most consciously, most resolutely and most accurately reflect and express the development of class interests and political groupings in society as a whole".

  

Mental workers are showing increased dissatisfaction. with their role in social production. The state monopoly capital has used scientific achievements in its own interests so as to keep most intellectuals from decision-making, from the management of production and society. Encouraging the training of specialists, modern capitalism makes it fractional and suppresses their critical thinking without which a genuine culture is not possible. The Programme of the Communist Party of the USA says that those who get higher education or a technical profession are faced with the prospect of becoming thoughtless wheels in the machine of automated production.

  

The profound crisis of bourgeois politics, ideology and culture as well as changes in the intellectuals' socio-economic position constitute an important basis for an alliance between the working class and a broad mass of intellectuals. The man-hating policy of imperialism which manifests itself in the arms race and the acts of aggression, in the violation of democratic rights, in the oppression of national and racial minorities like the black and coloured population in the USA, etc. have always caused active resistance on the part of pro gressive intellectuals and students. Their protest which culminated in the so-called "student revolution" in the late 1960-s, was the first mass anti-capitalist action of the intelligentsia. It broke out throughout the capitalist world and contributed a great deal to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, to the granting of formal rights to the black and coloured population in the USA, to the democratisation of the educational system in France and some other capitalist countries. Progressive intellectuals who are fighting imperialism, defending social justice and seeking a solution to global problems of mankind, are inevitably opposing the bourgeois order.

  

Ideologists of the "left" intelligentsia (G.Marcuse, J.-P.Sartre, T.Rozzack) and the mass student movement harshly criticised modern capitalism for imposing on them the psychology of thoughtless consumerism, for destroying the natural environment and disrupting normal social relations, for suppressing individuals and nations. But their positive programmes are purely utopian, indeed reactionary. Instead of social and political revolution they propose moral improvement, the limitation of science and technology, a return to nature, etc. Quite popular among intellectuals are moralist projects trying to unite Marxism and religion (E.Fromm, T.Raech), and pessimistic forecasts of a global disaster if the scientific and technological revolution continues (L.Mamford, J.Ellule). In their turn, bourgeois ideologists and mass media are whipping up social pessimism and religious fears in order to divert intellectuals from class, political struggle. The "new left" ideologists are criticising not only capitalism but also socialist countries and communist parties thus helping capitalism. Without any proof they accuse the working class in capitalist countries of turning "bourgeois", of integrating into the bourgeois system. They ascribe to socialism the evils of capitalism. They have tried to pass intellectuals and students as a revolutionary vanguard. They praised desultory actions of students and anarchist intellectuals as a counterweight to workers' parties, spontaneous and indiscriminate actions as a counterweight to conscious and purposeful revolutionary practice. Numerous terrorist organisations have sprung up among adventurist "ultra-left" intellectuals, demanding an "immediate overthrow of capitalism at all costs". They are directing their efforts mainly against liberal bourgeois leaders as well as activists in the work ing-class movement including communists.This "left" terrorism, widely spread in some European, Asian and Latin American countries, is used by the most reactionary bourgeois circles to discredit democratic forces. No wonder that "left" terrorists and fascists often flock together.

  

"Leftist" theories aim at tearing intellectuals away from the working class, at enhancing the influence of bourgeois ideology and, in the final analysis, at undermining the whole revolutionary movement in capitalist countries.

  

Bourgeois and reformist ideologists deliberately misinterpret facts, particularly the mass anti-capitalist movement of Western intellectuals in the late 1960-s and in the early 1970-s. They are spreading among intellectuals anti Marxist theories diverting them from a revolutionary path. They are trying to attract them with ideological and economic baits, to flatter them with talks about their "leading" role in society (theories of "technos acture" by G.Galbraith, of "meritocracy" and "scientific estate" by M. Young - D.Bell, of a "new middle class" by S.Malle, etc.). As Chairman of the Communist Party of the USA H.Winston said, it is fashionable to write and to speak about the emergence of a separate social "class of knowledge", a "class of specialists" including mental workers, to claim that the proletariat has no place in the social structure of a "post-industrial", "technotron" or "super-industrial" society based on science only. The advocates of these theories gloss over fundamental changes taking place in the socio-economic position of intellectuals, which objectively lead to a closeness between intellectuals and the working class. They ignore the fact that the movement of left intellectuals and students which sprang up in France in 1968 reached its utmost efficiency when it had merged with the struggle of the working class for their interests and against the foundations of the bourgeois regime.

  

The monopoly bourgeoisie have lately invited many outstanding scientists and experts as advisers and offered them high-ranking posts, including the government. They refer to H.Kissinger and Z.Brzezinski who were advisers of the U.S. president on national security (Kissinger was also Secretary of the State), the former French prime-minister R.Barr and some others as a sign of "intellectualisation" of capitalism. Some scholars who are serving state monopoly capitalism (E.Teller, E.Chain), are trying to shirk the responsibility for the development of new destructive weapons and to present technocratic intellectuals as "neutral" and working for "pure science". In the late 1970-s the bourgeois mass media widely advertised, as a "revelation", reactionary writings of so called "new philosophers", "new economists" and "new historians" who had attempted to rehabilitate capitalism ideologically and put down all troubles to the revolutionary and rationalist traditions in culture from the Enlightenment to Marxism. Most of intellectuals have rejected technocratic subservience to the bourgeoisie and spurious "neutrality" and pledged allegiance to the ideals of social justice.

  
  

**Communists and intellectuals**

  

The International Meeting of Communist Workers' Parties stated in 1969: "In this age, when science is becoming a direct productive force, growing numbers of intellectuals are swelling the ranks of wage and salary workers. Their social interests intertwine with those of the working class: their creative aspirations clash with the interests of the monopoly employers, who place profit above all else. Despite the great diversity in their positions, different groups of intellectuals are coming more and more into conflict with the monopolies and the imperialist policy of governments. The crisis of bourgeois ideology and the attraction to socialism help to bring intellectuals into the anti-imperialist struggle".

  

The participation of intellectuals and students in anti- monopoly and anti-imperialist actions is an important factor for stepping up class struggle in capitalist countries. The demands of those engaged in physical and mental work are getting closer. Intellectuals have often resorted to such forms of struggle initiated by the working class as strikes, mass demonstrations, boycotts, etc. Large groups of intellectuals (for example, teachers and civil servants) are gradually departing from narrow corporate structures, isolating them from other people, and joining the trade union movement.

  

Certainly, the similarity of interests between workers and intellectuals, the growing disillusionment of mental workers do not result automatically in their correct understanding of current changes or in their recognition of the need for unity with the working class, let alone its leading role. Matters are complicated by the bourgeois and petty bourgeois background and consciousness of intellectuals, by the long influence of bourgeois ideology, by petty bourgeois illusions and the lack of political experience.

  

Apart from many repressions against progressive intellectuals (bans on profession, denial of publication and speech, etc.), the bourgeoisie can use numerous methods of ideological and political pressures, bribe certain detachments of the intelligentsia, split its ranks in order to keep intellectuals away from the working class and to continue its own ideological and political influence on intellectuals. Specific corporate interests of certain intellectuals, particularly engineers and technicians (a strive to remain ‘’production organisers’’, career-seeking) keep them away from trade unions and sometimes even push them to actions against the working class, undertaken by capitalists. The democratisation and proletarisation of intellectuals should not therefore be idealised or oversimplified.

  

In this context, it is very important for communists to win intellectuals to the side of democracy and socialism. Communist and workers' parties attach a great importance to the alliance between the working class and intellectuals in the struggle against monopolies, for peace, democracy and socialism. The Political Declaration of Communist Parties of European Capitalist Countries (Brussels, 1974) stated that there is a broader basis for unity between the working class and the intelligentsia which is very important today. The French Communist Party stressed at its 19th Congress that this alliance is of paramount importance for the future revolutionary movement." Similar assessments can be found in programmatic documents adopted by communist parties of the USA, Canada, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Italy, Belgium, West Germany, etc.

  

In elaborating forms and methods of such an alliance, communist parties are aware of current socio-economic changes in certain groups of intellectuals in capitalist countries. They are analysing their specific requests and demands and trying to see where the interests of the working class and intellectuals meet.

  

With the help of outstanding intellectuals, many commu nist parties have elaborated programmes to promote culture, science, education, arts, information services, etc., as well as to improve the position and training intellectuals.

  

Communist parties are working to attract intellectuals to join the party. In Italy, France, Japan, Greece and other countries many leading personalities in science and culture are communists or sympathisers, who may even run on behalf of communist parties at elections. This heightens the political prestige of communists. As a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Austria E.Wimmer said: "To exercise its leading role, the working-class party must have intellectuals in its ranks. It needs the intellectuals' talent and knowledge, and their ability to influence the mass of mental workers. They would help to generalise the experience gained by the working class in struggle, evolve the strategy of transforming society and put it into practice."

  

Indeed, communist parties have involved intellectuals in the preparation of their alternative projects concerning various aspects of state and social policies, as well as in the solution of national and global problems. In the context of the economic and political crisis, intellectuals have helped to find progressive alternatives.

  

Intellectuals are coming to realise their genuine interests, to get rid of bourgeois, reformist and leftist influence, to transform their spontaneous discontent and protest into a purposeful movement allied to the working class.

  

Intellectuals are easier to win to the side of the working class if communists present well-grounded criticisms of bourgeois reformist and leftist theories and conduct large-scale propaganda of the scientific Marxist-Leninist ideology. Communist parties offer positive answers (in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism) to ideological and political preoccupations of intellectuals such as production and political democracy, freedom of creation in science and arts, national sovereignty, freedom, culture, humanism, etc.

  

Periodical publications for intellectuals are of great value. These publications can inform them of the achievements of socialist countries in the fields of science, technology and culture, launch debates on topical problems of politics, economics, philosophy and culture, propagate Marxism-Leninism.

  

Alongside ideological work among intellectuals, communists are also trying to establish and to consolidate professional organisations and associations of mental workers and to link them closely with workers' trade unions. Communists support mass actions of intellectuals for their vital demands and promote solidarity of the working class with such actions. At the same time, communists ensure that intellectuals support political and economic actions of the working class.

  

The alliance between the working class and the intelligentsia is valuable not only in the struggle against monopolies. V.I.Lenin said that the intelligentsia is needed "for our socialist revolution. We know socialism can only be built from elements of large-scale capitalist culture, and the intellectuals are one of these elements" that "we cannot build" the state "if we do not utilise such a heritage of capitalist culture as the intellectuals ". Through a stronger unity with intellectuals within a broad anti-monopoly and anti-imperialist front the working class can create favourable conditions for the building of socialism and communism which is its ultimate goal.
